And here we are again!

A new project, a new beginning. Or is this just more procrastination?

I think we all know the answer to that :D

Anyway, I've set up a new repository for my Rogue-Party project. Think Mario Party x Billion Road x Vamprire Survivors? It's early days yet, but I've got a bunch of ideas brewing and positive vibes form friends.

Time to setup a generic board, player and turn system. Then I get to play with the fun stuff.
